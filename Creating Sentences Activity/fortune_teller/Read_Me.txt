In order to actualy display each posibility,
and because the intructions said:
"The program should allow the user to pick a 
number between 0 to 10."
and to feel more complete, I looked up how to put 
user input, recalling it to be simple in python. 
I found window.prompt to be the simplest (and only) 
approch I could find without looking too long or 
into something too complex.

However, it also requires a .html, to actually make 
the window, so I used alerts for outputs.

However, I also did a non-html version with 
a predefined variable that can only be 
changed via edit.

this means the given "fortune_teller.html"
is required to run "fortune_teller_interactive.js", 
while "fortune_teller.js" is ran with VisualStudio.
Both should work perfectly fine with their 
respective methods.
