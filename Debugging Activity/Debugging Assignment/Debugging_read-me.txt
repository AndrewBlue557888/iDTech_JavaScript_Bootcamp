some things that may be important to note:

1. I did all 4 checkpoints, each should work fine, 
and are generally faithful to what's intended, 
with a few uncertainties.

2. in the first example, my method seems to be the 
intended one, but does not "count down from 5 to 1" as 
instructed in the TODO, I assume this is a mistake? 
and if not, is this still okay? I did the other 3 
anyway.

3. as for example 4, canceling gives a null, 
but the error just closes it, and it can be reopened 
without refreshing, so I assume that's intentional, 
especially since my first idea to have it check for 
null, would just make an endless loop, 
if it worked at all.

4. also in example 4, pass must be exactly 10 chars, 
given the wording of the prompt, I assume that's 
intentional too? I said such in my notes, but since 
it's not in the "DONT CHANGE" section, and since im 
writing this anyway, I figured I'd clarify.
